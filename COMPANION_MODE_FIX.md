# Companion Mode Fix

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

The "Failed to start companion mode" error occurs because:

1. **You previously activated SOS mode**, which created a companion session in the database
2. **The session is still marked as active** (wasn't properly stopped)
3. **Backend prevents multiple active sessions** - When you try to start companion mode, the backend checks for existing active sessions and rejects the request with a 400 error

## What I Fixed üîß

### Backend Changes ([companion.js](file://c:\Users\odane\Desktop\Projects\Guardian-Link-main\backend-nodejs\src\routes\companion.js))
- Updated error response to include details about the existing session
- Now returns session info including whether it was triggered by SOS

### Frontend Changes ([index.tsx](file://c:\Users\odane\Desktop\Projects\Guardian-Link-main\Guardian-Link-main\index.tsx))
- Added intelligent error handling that detects existing sessions
- Shows a confirmation dialog asking if you want to stop the existing session
- Automatically retries if you confirm

### API Changes ([api.ts](file://c:\Users\odane\Desktop\Projects\Guardian-Link-main\Guardian-Link-main\api.ts))
- Updated error handling to preserve additional error data from backend
- Errors now include `existingSession` details when available

## How It Works Now üöÄ

When you try to start companion mode:

1. **If there's an existing active session**, you'll see a prompt:
   ```
   You already have an active companion session (from SOS alert). 
   Would you like to stop it and start a new one?
   ```

2. **Click OK** to:
   - Stop the existing session
   - Automatically start the new companion mode

3. **Click Cancel** to:
   - Keep the existing session running
   - Cancel the new companion mode request

## Testing the Fix üß™

### Option 1: Simple Test (Recommended)
1. **Reload the frontend page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try to start companion mode again**
3. You should see the confirmation dialog
4. Click OK to stop the old session and start fresh

### Option 2: If Reload Doesn't Work
The backend might need a restart to pick up the changes. You can manually restart it:

1. **Stop the current backend terminal** (Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
2. **Restart backend**:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; cd "c:\Users\odane\Desktop\Projects\Guardian-Link-main\backend-nodejs"; npm run dev
   ```
3. **Reload the frontend page**
4. **Try companion mode again**

## Alternative: Clean Database Solution üóÑÔ∏è

If you want to completely clear all active sessions manually:

You can run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
UPDATE companion_sessions 
SET is_active = false, stopped_at = NOW() 
WHERE is_active = true;
```

This will mark all active sessions as stopped, allowing you to start fresh companion mode without any prompts.

## What This Means Going Forward üìù

- **SOS mode** creates a companion session automatically
- **Companion mode** requires no other active sessions
- **The system now handles conflicts gracefully** instead of just failing
- **Users get clear feedback** about why companion mode can't start and how to fix it

## Technical Details üîç

**Backend Error Response** (Before):
```json
{ "error": "You already have an active companion session" }
```

**Backend Error Response** (After):
```json
{
  "error": "You already have an active companion session",
  "existingSession": {
    "id": 1,
    "startTime": "2025-10-19T05:56:39.000Z",
    "endTime": "2025-10-19T06:56:39.000Z",
    "isSosTriggered": true
  }
}
```

**Frontend Behavior**:
- Detects `existingSession` in error
- Shows contextual message (indicates if from SOS)
- Offers to auto-cleanup and retry
- Handles the retry transparently
