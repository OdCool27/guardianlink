# AI-Powered Audio & Speech Distress Detection System - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds intelligent audio monitoring capabilities to the GuardianLink personal safety application. The system will continuously monitor audio input to detect signs of distress through speech recognition, natural language processing, and audio analysis, automatically triggering emergency protocols when potential threats are identified.

## Glossary

- **Web Speech API**: Browser API for speech recognition and synthesis
- **Web Audio API**: Browser API for audio processing and analysis
- **NLP Model**: Natural Language Processing model for text analysis
- **Distress Detection System**: The complete audio monitoring and analysis system
- **SOS Trigger**: Emergency alert activation mechanism
- **Verification Step**: User confirmation dialog before emergency activation
- **Audio Analysis Engine**: Component that processes audio for volume spikes and patterns
- **Speech Recognition Engine**: Component that converts speech to text
- **Distress Classification Service**: AI service that analyzes text for distress indicators
- **Emergency Response Handler**: Component that manages SOS activation and notifications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Speech Recognition Implementation

**User Story:** As a user in a potentially dangerous situation, I want the app to continuously monitor my speech so that it can detect when I'm in distress and need help.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables distress monitoring, THE Distress Detection System SHALL initialize the Web Speech API with continuous listening mode
2. WHILE distress monitoring is active, THE Speech Recognition Engine SHALL transcribe voice input into text in real-time
3. WHEN speech is detected, THE Speech Recognition Engine SHALL process the audio with noise filtering to reduce false positives
4. WHERE the user has granted microphone permissions, THE Distress Detection System SHALL maintain background listening capabilities
5. IF speech recognition fails or encounters errors, THEN THE Distress Detection System SHALL attempt to restart the service automatically

### Requirement 2: Distress Phrase Analysis

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to recognize when I'm saying distress-related phrases so that it can identify when I need emergency assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcribed text is received, THE Distress Classification Service SHALL analyze the text for distress-related phrases
2. THE Distress Classification Service SHALL detect phrases including "help me", "stop", "leave me alone", "I'm scared", "please no", "don't hurt me"
3. WHEN using local NLP processing, THE Distress Classification Service SHALL implement regex patterns and word embeddings for phrase detection
4. WHERE Hugging Face API is used, THE Distress Classification Service SHALL send text to the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model
5. IF distress phrases are detected with confidence above 70%, THEN THE Distress Detection System SHALL trigger the verification step

### Requirement 3: Audio Distress Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect sudden loud noises or screaming that might indicate I'm in danger, even if I can't speak clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distress monitoring is active, THE Audio Analysis Engine SHALL continuously monitor decibel levels using Web Audio API
2. THE Audio Analysis Engine SHALL detect sudden volume spikes that exceed 80dB above baseline
3. WHEN screaming patterns or impact sounds are detected, THE Audio Analysis Engine SHALL trigger distress verification
4. THE Audio Analysis Engine SHALL implement frequency analysis to distinguish between normal speech and distress sounds
5. IF audio distress patterns are detected, THEN THE Distress Detection System SHALL initiate the verification step

### Requirement 4: User Verification Process

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to ask for confirmation before triggering emergency alerts so that false alarms are minimized while ensuring real emergencies are handled quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distress is suspected, THE Distress Detection System SHALL display a verification popup with the message "We detected signs of distress. Are you okay?"
2. THE Distress Detection System SHALL provide two response options: "Yes, I'm fine" and "No, I need help"
3. WHEN the user selects "Yes, I'm fine", THE Distress Detection System SHALL dismiss the alert and continue monitoring
4. WHEN the user selects "No, I need help", THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL immediately trigger SOS protocols
5. IF no user response is received within 10 seconds, THEN THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL automatically trigger SOS protocols

### Requirement 5: Emergency Response Integration

**User Story:** As a user in distress, I want the system to automatically contact my emergency contacts and log the incident when distress is confirmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SOS is triggered by distress detection, THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL call the existing backend SOS endpoint
2. THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL send SMS and email alerts to all configured emergency contacts
3. THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL include audio distress detection as the trigger reason in notifications
4. THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL log the distress detection event with timestamp and detection method
5. THE Emergency Response Handler SHALL activate location sharing for emergency contacts automatically

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Permissions Management

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want explicit control over microphone access and audio processing so that my privacy is protected while using safety features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Distress Detection System SHALL request explicit microphone permissions before activating audio monitoring
2. WHEN local processing is used, THE Distress Detection System SHALL process all audio data locally without external transmission
3. WHERE AI API services are used, THE Distress Detection System SHALL obtain explicit user consent before sending audio data externally
4. THE Distress Detection System SHALL provide clear privacy notices explaining what audio data is collected and how it's processed
5. WHEN the user revokes permissions, THE Distress Detection System SHALL immediately stop all audio monitoring and processing

### Requirement 7: System Configuration and Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure distress detection settings and enable/disable the feature as needed so that I have control over when the system is active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Distress Detection System SHALL provide a settings interface for enabling/disabling audio monitoring
2. THE Distress Detection System SHALL allow users to configure sensitivity levels for audio and speech detection
3. THE Distress Detection System SHALL provide options to choose between local NLP processing and cloud-based AI services
4. THE Distress Detection System SHALL display the current monitoring status clearly in the user interface
5. WHEN distress detection is active, THE Distress Detection System SHALL show a persistent indicator that monitoring is enabled
