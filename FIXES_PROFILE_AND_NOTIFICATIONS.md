# Issues Fixed - Profile & Notifications

## Issue #1: Empty Username and Email in Profile ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
When logged in, the profile screen showed empty fields for username and email address.

### Root Cause
The frontend was calling `/api/user/profile` but the backend endpoint is actually `/api/user/me`.

Backend log showed:
```
GET /api/user/profile 404 0.223 ms - 27
```

### Solution
Updated the API client ([`api.ts`](./Guardian-Link-main/api.ts)) to use the correct endpoints:

**Before:**
```typescript
getProfile: async () => {
  return apiRequest('/api/user/profile', { method: 'GET' });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
getProfile: async () => {
  return apiRequest('/api/user/me', { method: 'GET' });
}
```

Also fixed:
- `updateProfile` ‚Üí uses `/api/user/me`
- `updateSettings` ‚Üí new method using `/api/user/settings`
- `updateLocation` ‚Üí fixed from `/api/companion/update-location` to `/api/companion/location`

### Test It
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to Profile tab
3. **You should now see**:
   - ‚úÖ Your full name displayed
   - ‚úÖ Your email address displayed
   - ‚úÖ All profile fields populated correctly

## Issue #2: No In-App Notifications for SOS ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
When a user sends an SOS alert, emergency contacts receive email/SMS but there's no notification within the app itself.

### Root Cause
The app was only sending external notifications (email/SMS) but had no in-app notification system for companions to see alerts in real-time.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Added Polling for Shared Sessions**

Created a mechanism to check for new companion sessions and SOS alerts every 10 seconds:

```typescript
// Poll for sessions shared with me
useEffect(() => {
  const checkSharedSessions = async () => {
    const sessions = await companionAPI.getSharedWithMe();
    // Create notifications for new sessions
    sessions.forEach(session => {
      if (isNew) {
        const notification = {
          type: session.isSosTriggered ? 'sos' : 'companion',
          user: session.user?.fullName,
          sessionId: session.id
        };
        setNotifications(prev => [notification, ...prev]);
      }
    });
  };
  
  // Check every 10 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(checkSharedSessions, 10000);
}, []);
```

#### 2. **Created Visual Notification Component**

Added a notification banner system that appears at the top of the screen:

- **SOS Alerts**: Red/danger themed with üö® icon
- **Companion Mode**: Blue themed with üìç icon

#### 3. **Added New API Endpoint**

Added `companionAPI.getSharedWithMe()` to fetch active sessions shared with the current user:

```typescript
getSharedWithMe: async () => {
  return apiRequest('/api/companion/shared-with-me', { method: 'GET' });
}
```

This endpoint was already implemented in the backend but not connected to the frontend.

### How It Works

1. **User A** sends SOS or starts companion mode with **User B** as emergency contact
2. **Backend** creates a companion session and links User B
3. **User B's app** polls `/api/companion/shared-with-me` every 10 seconds
4. **New sessions detected** ‚Üí Notification appears in User B's app
5. **Notification shows**:
   - Icon (üö® for SOS, üìç for companion mode)
   - Alert type (SOS ALERT or Location Sharing)
   - Message: "Alice Test needs help!" or "Alice Test is sharing their location with you"
   - Close button (√ó)

### Notification Types

| Type | Icon | Color | Message |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| **SOS** | üö® | Red border, danger gradient | "[Name] needs help!" |
| **Companion** | üìç | Blue border, accent gradient | "[Name] is sharing their location with you" |

### Test It

#### Setup Two Users:
**User A (Alice):**
- Window: http://localhost:3001/
- Email: alice@test.com

**User B (Bob):**
- Window: http://localhost:5174/
- Email: bob@test.com

#### Test SOS Notification:
1. **In Alice's window**: Click SOS button and wait for countdown
2. **In Bob's window (within 10 seconds)**:
   - ‚úÖ Red notification appears at top of screen
   - ‚úÖ Shows: "üö® SOS ALERT - Alice Test needs help!"
   - ‚úÖ Can click √ó to dismiss

#### Test Companion Mode Notification:
1. **In Alice's window**: Start companion mode, select Bob, 5 minutes
2. **In Bob's window (within 10 seconds)**:
   - ‚úÖ Blue notification appears at top of screen
   - ‚úÖ Shows: "üìç Location Sharing - Alice Test is sharing their location with you"
   - ‚úÖ Can click √ó to dismiss

### Notification Behavior

- **Automatic detection**: Checks every 10 seconds
- **Multiple notifications**: Can show multiple active alerts
- **Dismissible**: Click √ó to remove
- **Persistent**: Stays until manually dismissed
- **Styled**: Matches app theme (light/dark mode)
- **Positioned**: Top center of screen, doesn't block main content

### Files Modified

1. **[`api.ts`](./Guardian-Link-main/api.ts)**
   - Fixed `/api/user/profile` ‚Üí `/api/user/me`
   - Fixed `/api/companion/update-location` ‚Üí `/api/companion/location`
   - Added `getSharedWithMe()` method

2. **[`index.tsx`](./Guardian-Link-main/index.tsx)**
   - Added `sharedSessions` state
   - Added `notifications` state
   - Added polling useEffect for shared sessions
   - Added notification UI component
   - Notification system integrated into App component

3. **[`index.css`](./Guardian-Link-main/index.css)**
   - Added `.notifications-container` styles
   - Added `.notification` and variants (.sos, .companion)
   - Added `.notification-content`, `.notification-icon`, `.notification-text`
   - Added `.notification-close` button styles

### Current Limitations

These features are **planned but not yet implemented**:

‚ùå Real-time WebSocket updates (currently polls every 10 seconds)
‚ùå Click notification to view shared location
‚ùå Notification sound/vibration
‚ùå Push notifications (requires PWA)
‚ùå Notification history/log

### Future Enhancements

**High Priority:**
- Real-time WebSocket for instant notifications (no 10-second delay)
- Click notification to navigate to shared location view
- Show live location map of person who sent alert

**Medium Priority:**
- Notification sound/vibration
- Mark notifications as read/unread
- Notification history in History tab

**Low Priority:**
- Push notifications (PWA)
- Customizable notification preferences
- Snooze/mute options
